      amount: 450.50,
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
    });

    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Category:', result.data.category);
      console.log('Confidence:', result.data.confidence);

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. **Provide Context**

The more context you provide, the better the AI performs:

```typescript
// Good
await categorize.mutateAsync({
  description: "3/4 inch marine-grade plywood for deck framing",
  amount: 890,
  projectId: "proj_123"  // Provides project context
});

// Less optimal
await categorize.mutateAsync({
  description: "wood",
  amount: 890
});
```

### 2. **Review AI Suggestions**

Always review AI-generated content, especially:
- Project quotes (verify pricing and assumptions)
- Risk assessments (confirm identified risks are relevant)
- Time estimates (adjust based on your team's experience)

### 3. **Provide Feedback**

The AI learns from usage:
- Correct miscategorizations
- Update time estimates with actuals
- Report inaccurate predictions

### 4. **Monitor Performance**

Check the AI statistics dashboard regularly:
- Track accuracy over time
- Monitor rate limit usage
- Review cache hit rates

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding

1. Check API key is configured: `echo $GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. Verify AI health: GET `/api/v1/ai/health`
3. Check rate limits: GET `/api/v1/ai/stats`
4. Review server logs for errors

### Low Confidence Scores

If AI confidence scores are consistently low (<0.7):
- Provide more detailed descriptions
- Include project context
- Add more historical data
- Use more specific terminology

### Incorrect Categorizations

- Review the reasoning provided
- Ensure description is accurate and detailed
- Check if it's a new type of expense (add to training)
- Manually correct and the AI will learn
