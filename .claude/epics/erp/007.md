# Task 007: Real-time Synchronization & WebSocket Engine

## Description

Implement a comprehensive real-time synchronization system using Socket.io to enable live updates across all ERP modules. This foundational system will support real-time collaboration, live data updates, and conflict resolution mechanisms to ensure data consistency across multiple users and sessions.

The WebSocket engine will serve as the backbone for all real-time features including live project updates, instant notifications, collaborative editing, and synchronized data views across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core WebSocket Infrastructure
- [ ] Socket.io server implementation with room-based organization
- [ ] Client-side WebSocket connection management with auto-reconnection
- [ ] Authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Session management and user presence tracking
- [ ] Connection pooling and load balancing preparation

### Real-time Data Synchronization
- [ ] Live updates for project data changes
- [ ] Real-time customer/contact modifications
- [ ] Instant inventory level updates
- [ ] Live financial data synchronization
- [ ] Document collaboration with conflict resolution

### Conflict Resolution System
- [ ] Optimistic locking with version control
- [ ] Last-write-wins strategy with user notification
- [ ] Merge conflict detection and resolution UI
- [ ] Rollback capabilities for data conflicts
- [ ] Change history tracking and audit trails

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Message queuing for offline users
- [ ] Rate limiting and connection throttling
- [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Memory leak prevention and cleanup
- [ ] Monitoring and health check endpoints

## Technical Details

### Socket.io Implementation
```typescript
// Server-side socket configuration
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
    credentials: true
  },
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
});

// Room-based organization
io.use(authenticateSocket);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.join(`user_${socket.userId}`);
  socket.join(`company_${socket.companyId}`);
});
```

### Real-time Event System
- **Project Events**: `project:updated`, `project:deleted`, `task:assigned`
- **Financial Events**: `invoice:paid`, `expense:approved`, `payment:processed`
- **Inventory Events**: `stock:updated`, `item:added`, `reorder:triggered`
- **User Events**: `user:online`, `user:typing`, `user:idle`

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
```typescript
interface ConflictResolution {
  strategy: 'last-write-wins' | 'merge' | 'manual';
  timestamp: Date;
  conflictedFields: string[];
  originalValue: any;
  incomingValue: any;
  resolvedValue: any;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios
- Message batching for bulk updates
- Selective event subscriptions to reduce bandwidth
- Client-side caching with invalidation strategies

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Task 004**: Database schema and migrations must be complete
- **Task 005**: API endpoints need to be established for data operations
- Socket.io and related WebSocket libraries
- Redis for session storage and message queuing

### Integration Points
- Authentication system integration
- Database change detection mechanisms
- Frontend state management synchronization
- Logging and monitoring systems

## Effort Estimate

**Total: 3-4 weeks (120-160 hours)**

### Breakdown:
- **Socket.io Infrastructure** (1 week): Server setup, client connection management
- **Real-time Events** (1 week): Event system, room management, presence tracking
- **Conflict Resolution** (1 week): Version control, merge strategies, UI components
- **Testing & Optimization** (1 week): Performance testing, load testing, bug fixes

### Team Requirements:
- 1 Senior Backend Developer (WebSocket expertise)
- 1 Frontend Developer (real-time UI updates)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (infrastructure scaling)
