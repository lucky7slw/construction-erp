# Task: External Integrations & Production Deployment

## Description

Implement critical external integrations with Google Workspace, accounting systems (QuickBooks/Xero), and banking APIs, followed by production deployment setup. This final task ensures the ERP system seamlessly connects with existing business tools and is deployed with proper monitoring, security, and scalability.

This includes setting up the production infrastructure, implementing CI/CD pipelines, configuring monitoring and alerting, and ensuring the system meets all security and performance requirements for a construction company.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Google Workspace integration (Calendar, Gmail, Drive) fully functional
- [ ] QuickBooks/Xero integration for financial data synchronization
- [ ] Banking API integration for transaction import and categorization
- [ ] Production cloud infrastructure deployed and configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automated for deployments
- [ ] Monitoring, logging, and alerting systems operational
- [ ] Security hardening and penetration testing completed
- [ ] Performance optimization and load testing validated
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures implemented
- [ ] User training materials and documentation completed

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP with auto-scaling and load balancing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability with error tracking and performance metrics
- **Security**: OWASP Top 10 compliance, SSL certificates, and data encryption
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database backups with point-in-time recovery

### Key Integrations to Build
- Google Calendar sync for project schedules and team coordination
- Gmail integration for automatic email tracking and CRM updates
- Google Drive integration for document storage and collaboration
- QuickBooks/Xero API for financial data import and export
- Banking APIs (Plaid) for transaction categorization and expense tracking
- SMS/Push notification services for mobile alerts

### Code Locations
- `/src/integrations/` - All external API integrations
- `/src/services/sync/` - Data synchronization services
- `/infrastructure/` - Cloud infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- `/scripts/deployment/` - Deployment and migration scripts
- `/.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline configurations

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 008: Project Management Features (complete system functionality)
- [ ] Task 009: CRM & Quote System (complete business workflows)
- [ ] Google Workspace admin access and API credentials
- [ ] QuickBooks/Xero developer account and API access
- [ ] Banking API (Plaid) account and integration approval
- [ ] Cloud provider account with appropriate service limits
- [ ] SSL certificates and domain configuration

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: Extra Large (XL)
- **Hours**: 88 hours
- **Parallel**: false (final integration and deployment phase)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Google Workspace integrations: 20 hours
  - Accounting software integrations: 16 hours
  - Banking API integration: 12 hours
  - Production infrastructure setup: 16 hours
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration: 8 hours
  - Security hardening and testing: 12 hours
  - Performance optimization: 4 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All external integrations tested and functional in production
- [ ] Google Workspace sync working bidirectionally
- [ ] Financial data flowing correctly between accounting systems
- [ ] Banking transactions automatically categorized and imported
- [ ] Production system deployed with 99.9% uptime target
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline delivering automated deployments
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards showing system health and performance
- [ ] Security audit passed with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Load testing validates 500+ concurrent user capacity
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested and documented
- [ ] User training completed and system ready for launch
