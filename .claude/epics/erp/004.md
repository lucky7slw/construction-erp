# Task 004: Web Frontend Framework & Design System

## Description

Establish the complete web frontend foundation using Next.js 14+ with a modern 2026 UI/UX design system. This task focuses on creating a responsive, performant web application with Tailwind CSS styling, custom component library, and state management architecture that will serve as the primary interface for the construction AI-ERP system.

The frontend must support real-time updates, be mobile-first responsive, and integrate seamlessly with the backend API while providing an intuitive user experience for construction industry workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Framework Setup
- [ ] Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configured with custom design tokens
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code style
- [ ] Husky pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement
- [ ] Development and production build configurations optimized

### Design System & Components
- [ ] Custom component library with 20+ reusable components
- [ ] Design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and animations
- [ ] Responsive breakpoint system for mobile-first design
- [ ] Accessible components meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Storybook setup for component documentation and testing
- [ ] Micro-animations using Framer Motion for enhanced UX

### State Management
- [ ] Zustand configured for client-side state management
- [ ] React Query/TanStack Query for server state synchronization
- [ ] WebSocket connection manager for real-time updates
- [ ] Error boundary components for graceful error handling
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton components for better UX

### Core Layout & Navigation
- [ ] Responsive dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
- [ ] Header with user profile, notifications, and search
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation for deep page hierarchies
- [ ] Modal and drawer components for overlay interactions
- [ ] Toast notification system for user feedback

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Code splitting and lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- [ ] SEO optimization with meta tags and Open Graph
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- [ ] Bundle analysis and optimization for <3s load times

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3+ with custom configuration
- **State Management**: Zustand for local state, React Query for server state
- **UI Components**: Custom component library built from scratch
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for micro-interactions
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Documentation**: Storybook for component library

### Architecture Decisions
- **Mobile-First Design**: All components designed for mobile, enhanced for desktop
- **Component Composition**: Compound components pattern for flexibility
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties with Tailwind for dynamic theming
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with no any types
- **Accessibility**: Built-in ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets, memoization strategies

### Component Library Structure
```
/components
  /ui           # Basic UI components (Button, Input, Card)
  /layout       # Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Container)
  /forms        # Form-specific components (FormField, FormError)
  /data         # Data display components (Table, DataGrid, Chart)
  /feedback     # User feedback (Toast, Modal, Alert)
  /navigation   # Navigation components (Nav, Breadcrumb, Pagination)
```

### Design System Specifications
- **Color Palette**: Construction industry-appropriate colors with accessibility considerations
- **Typography**: Clean, readable font system with 5 weight variants
- **Spacing System**: 8px base unit with consistent scaling
- **Border Radius**: Subtle rounded corners for modern appearance
- **Shadows**: Layered shadow system for depth perception
- **Animations**: 60fps micro-animations with reduced-motion support

## Dependencies

### Required Completion
- **Task 003**: Core Backend Services must be completed for API integration
- Authentication endpoints available for user login/logout
- Basic project management API endpoints for data fetching
- WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates

### External Dependencies
- Design assets and style guide from UI/UX designer
- Brand guidelines and construction industry color palette
- API documentation and endpoint specifications
- Responsive design breakpoint requirements

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort**: 6 weeks (240 hours)

### Week-by-week Breakdown
- **Week 1**: Next.js setup, Tailwind configuration, basic component architecture (40 hours)
- **Week 2**: Core UI components, design tokens, accessibility implementation (40 hours)
- **Week 3**: Layout components, navigation, responsive design system (40 hours)
- **Week 4**: State management setup, API integration, real-time connections (40 hours)
- **Week 5**: Advanced components, form handling, data visualization prep (40 hours)
- **Week 6**: Performance optimization, testing, Storybook documentation (40 hours)

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Component documentation can be written while components are developed
- Performance testing can run alongside development
- Design system refinement based on real implementation feedback

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All components render correctly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Real-time updates work seamlessly without page refreshes
- [ ] Form validation provides immediate, helpful feedback
- [ ] Navigation works intuitively with proper loading states
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages API failures

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for all components and utilities
- [ ] All accessibility audits pass with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score >90 on production build
- [ ] TypeScript compilation with zero errors or warnings
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier rules pass with no violations

### Documentation Requirements
