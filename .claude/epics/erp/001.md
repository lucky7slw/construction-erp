# Task 001: Foundation Setup & Development Environment

## Description

Establish the foundational development environment and project structure for the ERP system. This includes setting up the monorepo structure, development tooling, CI/CD pipeline, and project scaffolding that will support all subsequent development work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Monorepo structure established with proper workspace configuration
- [ ] Development environment fully configured with Docker and docker-compose
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline implemented with automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Code quality tools integrated (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode)
- [ ] Environment configuration management system in place
- [ ] Development documentation created for team onboarding
- [ ] Local development workflow validated end-to-end

## Technical Details

### Project Structure
```

├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # Backend API service
│   ├── web/          # Frontend web application
│   └── mobile/       # Mobile application (future)
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/       # Shared utilities and types
│   ├── database/     # Database schemas and migrations
│   └── ui/           # Shared UI components
├── tools/
│   ├── eslint-config/
│   └── typescript-config/
├── docker/
│   ├── development/
│   └── production/
└── docs/
```

### Technology Stack
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspace support
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ LTS
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged

### Development Environment
- Docker containers for all services (API, Database, Redis)
- Hot reload for both frontend and backend
- Consistent environment variables across all environments
- Database seeding for development data

## Dependencies

This is the entry point task with no dependencies.

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Large (L)
**Hours**: 16-20 hours

### Breakdown:
- Monorepo setup and workspace configuration: 4 hours
- Docker environment setup: 4 hours
- CI/CD pipeline implementation: 6 hours
- Code quality tools integration: 3 hours
- Documentation and validation: 3 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All developers can clone repo and run `pnpm dev` to start full environment
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes all checks on main branch
- [ ] Code quality gates prevent commits that don't meet standards
- [ ] Environment variables are properly managed across dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Docker containers start successfully and can communicate
- [ ] Development documentation is complete and validated by team member
- [ ] All linting and formatting tools are configured and working
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode is enabled and all checks pass
