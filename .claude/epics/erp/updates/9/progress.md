# Issue #9: Project Management Features & Gantt Charts - Progress

**Started**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: In Progress

## Completed

### Phase 1: Database Schema Extension âœ…
- [x] Added `startDate`, `progress`, `isMilestone` fields to Task model
- [x] Created `TaskDependency` model with FS/SS/FF/SF types
- [x] Added GPS fields to TimeEntry (latitude, longitude, accuracy)
- [x] Added AI categorization flags (aiSuggested, aiCategorized)
- [x] Created migration ready to apply

## In Progress

### Phase 2: Backend Services ðŸš§
- [ ] Gantt chart calculation service
- [ ] Critical path algorithm
- [ ] Task scheduling service
- [ ] GPS validation service for time entries
- [ ] AI time allocation suggestions

## Todo

### Phase 3: API Endpoints
- [ ] Task dependency endpoints (CRUD)
- [ ] Gantt chart data endpoint
- [ ] GPS-validated time entry endpoints
- [ ] AI-powered expense categorization endpoint
- [ ] Progress reporting endpoints

### Phase 4: WebSocket Integration
- [ ] Real-time task updates
- [ ] Real-time dependency changes
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking
- [ ] Live Gantt chart synchronization

### Phase 5: Frontend Components
- [ ] Interactive Gantt chart component
- [ ] Drag-and-drop task scheduling
- [ ] Dependency visualization
- [ ] Critical path highlighting
- [ ] Progress tracking dashboard
- [ ] Time tracking with GPS component
- [ ] Expense management with photo upload

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Unit tests for Gantt calculations
- [ ] Integration tests for WebSocket events
- [ ] E2E tests for Gantt interactions
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guide for Gantt features

## Notes

- Database migration pending (requires running PostgreSQL instance)
- Following TDD approach for all new services
- WebSocket infrastructure already in place from Issue #8
- AI services available from Issue #7

## Next Steps

1. Implement Gantt calculation service with TDD
2. Create critical path algorithm
3. Build API endpoints for task dependencies
4. Integrate with WebSocket for real-time updates
5. Implement frontend Gantt component
