## Technical Notes

### AI Quote Generation Implementation Details
- Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash model
- Analyzes up to 10 most recent completed projects
- Calculates similarity scores for historical projects
- Provides market rate benchmarks for various trades
- Includes waste factors (10-15%) for materials
- Applies profit margin to total costs
- Generates detailed risk assessment
- Provides confidence scores based on data availability

### Quote Service Architecture
- `QuoteService` class handles all quote-related operations
- Integrates with `AIService` for intelligent generation
- Uses `prisma` for database operations
- Implements quote versioning for revision tracking
- Supports filtering by company, customer, and lead

### API Endpoint Structure
- CRM: `/api/v1/crm/` (leads, interactions, follow-ups, pipeline)
- Quotes: `/api/v1/quotes/` (generate, manage, versions, approvals)
- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Comprehensive Swagger documentation

### Database Schema
- All required tables already exist in schema
- `quotes` table with AI analysis data (JSON)
- `quoteItems` for itemized costs
- `quoteVersions` for revision history
- `quoteApprovals` for workflow management
- `leads` table for CRM
- `customerInteractions` for timeline
- `followUpTasks` for task management

## Performance Metrics

### Quote Generation Performance
- **Target**: < 10 minutes per quote
- **Test Timeout**: 600,000ms (10 minutes)
- **Expected Average**: 30-120 seconds for typical projects
- **Factors Affecting Speed**:
  - Number of historical projects analyzed
  - Complexity of project scope
  - Number of requirements
  - AI API response time

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- [x] CRM Service tests (comprehensive, all passing)
- [x] Quote Service tests (comprehensive, requires DB)
- [ ] WebSocket event tests for CRM/Quotes

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end quote generation flow
- [ ] Quote approval workflow
- [ ] PDF generation and delivery
- [ ] Email notifications

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Quote generation under load
- [ ] Concurrent quote requests
- [ ] Historical data analysis scalability

## Known Issues

1. **Database Required for Tests**: Quote service tests require PostgreSQL and Redis to be running

3. **PDF Generation Not Implemented**: Need to choose and implement PDF library

## Next Steps

1. **Implement WebSocket Events** (Priority: High)
   - Add event emissions to QuoteService and CRMService
   - Test real-time updates in WebSocket service

2. **Implement PDF Generation** (Priority: High)

3. **Add Email Integration** (Priority: Medium)
   - Configure SMTP service
   - Create email templates
   - Implement quote delivery
   - Add approval notifications

4. **Frontend Development** (Priority: Medium)
   - Build CRM dashboard
   - Create quote generation interface
   - Implement pipeline visualization
   - Add approval workflow UI

5. **Mobile App Features** (Priority: Low)
   - Adapt CRM for mobile use
   - Add offline support
   - Implement field interactions
