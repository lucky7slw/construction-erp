- `quote:version_created` - Broadcast when new version is saved
- `approval:requested` - Notify approver and broadcast to company
- `approval:responded` - Notify requester and broadcast to company

#### CRM Events
- `lead:created` - Broadcast when new lead is captured
- `lead:updated` - Broadcast when lead is modified (with change tracking)
- `lead:assigned` - Notify assigned user
- `lead:unassigned` - Notify when lead is reassigned
- `lead:converted` - Broadcast when lead converts to customer
- `customer:interaction` - Broadcast and notify assignee
- `followup:created` - Broadcast and notify assignee

- `followup:completed` - Broadcast task completions

#### Event Targeting
- **Company-wide broadcasts**: All users in the company receive updates
- **User-specific notifications**: Assigned users receive personal notifications
- **Smart routing**: Events only sent to relevant users (e.g., lead assignee)

### 5. API Endpoints

- `CreateInteractionSchema`
- `CreateFollowUpSchema`, `UpdateFollowUpSchema`
- `QuoteGenerationRequestSchema`
- `CreateQuoteVersionSchema`
- `CreateQuoteApprovalSchema`, `UpdateQuoteApprovalSchema`

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Service Layer Design
- Services are designed to work with or without WebSocket integration
- WebSocket service is optional dependency (dependency injection)
- Services emit events for important business actions
- Event emission doesn't block main operations

### Data Flow
```
Client Request
    ↓
API Route (Validation)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Database (Prisma)
    ↓
WebSocket Events (Real-time)
    ↓
Connected Clients
```

### AI Quote Generation Flow
```
Request + Historical Data
    ↓
AI Prompt Template Rendering
    ↓
Gemini API Call
    ↓
JSON Response Parsing & Validation
    ↓
Database Persistence
    ↓
WebSocket Event Emission
    ↓
Real-time UI Updates
```

### Quote Number Generation
- Format: `QUO-YYYY-NNNN`
- Year-based sequences
- Automatic increment within company
- Zero-padded 4-digit counter

## Database Schema Utilization

### Existing Tables Used
- `leads` - Lead tracking and management
- `customerInteractions` - Interaction history
- `followUpTasks` - Task management
- `quotes` - Quote storage with AI analysis data
- `quoteItems` - Itemized costs
- `quoteVersions` - Revision history
- `quoteApprovals` - Approval workflow
- `customers` - Customer information
- `projects` - Historical data for AI analysis
- `companies` - Multi-tenant data isolation

### Key Schema Features
- `aiGenerated` flag on quotes
- `aiAnalysisData` JSON field for storing AI insights
- `profitMargin` tracking on quotes
- `qualificationScore` on leads (AI-generated)
- `convertedAt` timestamp on leads
- `lostReason` field for lost leads

## Testing

### Test Files Created
- `apps/api/src/services/quotes/quote.service.test.ts` (comprehensive test suite)
- `apps/api/src/services/crm/crm.service.test.ts` (already existed, comprehensive)

### Test Coverage Areas
- AI quote generation with historical analysis
- Quote itemization and calculation accuracy
- Market rate analysis
- Risk assessment
- Quote versioning
- Lead management lifecycle
- Interaction tracking
- Follow-up task workflow
- Pipeline metrics calculation
- Conversion tracking

### Test Requirements
- PostgreSQL database must be running
- Redis instance must be available
- Valid GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable

## Performance Considerations

### Quote Generation Optimization
- Limits historical project analysis to 10 most recent projects
- Efficient database queries with specific field selection
- Caching opportunity in AI service layer
- Async operations don't block WebSocket events

### WebSocket Scalability
- Redis adapter enables horizontal scaling
- Room-based targeting reduces unnecessary broadcasts
- Event payload optimization (only essential data)

### Database Query Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently filtered fields
- Pagination support in list endpoints
- Selective field loading to reduce data transfer

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication on all endpoints
- User context attached to all operations
- Company-based data isolation
- Role-based access control ready (schema supports)

### Data Privacy
- WebSocket events respect company boundaries
- Users only receive events for their company
- Personal notifications only to relevant users

## API Documentation

All endpoints are documented using OpenAPI/Swagger:
- Available at `/docs` when server is running
- Interactive API testing interface
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Example payloads

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **PDF Generation** (8-12 hours)
   - Choose library (puppeteer vs react-pdf)
   - Design professional quote template
   - Include company branding
   - Add PDF download endpoint

2. **Email Integration** (4-6 hours)
   - Configure SMTP service
   - Create email templates
   - Implement quote delivery
   - Add approval notification emails

### Medium Priority
3. **Frontend Development** (20-30 hours)
   - CRM dashboard component
   - Lead management UI
   - Quote generation form
   - Quote preview/edit interface
   - Pipeline visualization
   - Approval workflow UI

4. **Testing Infrastructure** (4-6 hours)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for quote generation flow
   - Performance tests for AI quote generation

### Low Priority
5. **Mobile App Features** (10-15 hours)
   - Mobile-optimized CRM interface
   - Quick interaction logging
   - Offline support
   - Field sales features

## Key Learnings & Best Practices

### AI Integration
- Always validate AI responses with Zod schemas
- Provide comprehensive context in prompts
- Include market rate benchmarks in prompts
- Parse JSON carefully (AI may add extra text)
- Track generation time for performance monitoring

### WebSocket Event Design
- Keep event payloads small but informative
- Emit events after successful database operations
- Target events appropriately (company vs user)
- Include timestamps for all events
- Use descriptive event names with namespaces

### Service Layer Patterns
- Optional dependencies using dependency injection
- Services should work standalone (WebSocket optional)
- Emit events for significant business actions
- Don't block main flow with event emission

### Quote Generation Strategy
- Use historical data for pricing intelligence
- Provide market rate guidance to AI
- Include waste factors and contingencies
- Track confidence scores
- Document assumptions and risks
- Apply profit margins consistently

## Performance Metrics

### Quote Generation
- **Target**: < 10 minutes
- **Expected**: 30-120 seconds
- **Factors**:
  - Historical project count
  - Project complexity
  - AI API latency
  - Network conditions

### API Response Times
- List operations: < 200ms (with pagination)
- Single item retrieval: < 50ms
- AI operations: 10-120 seconds
- WebSocket event emission: < 10ms
