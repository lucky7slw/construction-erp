# Epic: Construction AI-ERP System

## Overview

Implementation of a comprehensive, AI-first ERP system specifically designed for construction companies. The system leverages a modern full-stack architecture with Next.js/React frontend, Node.js/TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL database, and native iOS companion app. Gemini AI serves as the core intelligence engine for automation, categorization, and predictive analytics.

**Technical Focus**: Mobile-first design with offline capabilities, real-time synchronization, and seamless integration with Google Workspace and external accounting systems.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend Web**: Next.js 14+ with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for modern 2026 UI/UX
- **Backend API**: Node.js with Express.js/Fastify, TypeScript for type safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM for schema management and migrations
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and real-time data caching
- **Mobile**: Swift/SwiftUI for native iOS app with Core Data for offline storage
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API with custom prompt engineering and context management
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for live dashboard updates and collaborative features

### Deployment Strategy
- **Primary**: Cloud-first SaaS deployment with subdomain routing (company.erp-domain.com)
- **Fallback**: On-premise capability using Docker containers on MacBook Pro A2141
- **CDN**: Cloudflare for global asset delivery and DDoS protection
- **Monitoring**: Integrated observability with error tracking and performance monitoring

### Data Architecture
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models for complex reporting vs. operational data
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trails and 30-day soft delete requirements
- **AI Context Store**: Vector database (Pinecone/Chroma) for AI memory and project pattern recognition

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Design System**: Custom component library with 2026 design standards, micro-animations
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection manager with automatic reconnection
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement for desktop
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support

### Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting, authentication, request routing to microservices
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Project Management Service**: Gantt chart data, timeline calculations, resource allocation
- **AI Service**: Gemini API integration with prompt management and response caching
- **CRM Service**: Lead management, quote generation, customer interaction tracking
- **Integration Service**: Google Workspace, QuickBooks/Xero, banking APIs
- **Notification Service**: Email, SMS, push notifications for iOS app

### Mobile App Architecture
- **Native iOS**: Swift/SwiftUI for optimal performance and iOS integration
- **Offline-First**: Core Data with CloudKit sync for seamless online/offline experience
- **Location Services**: GPS validation for time tracking with geofencing
- **Camera Integration**: Native photo capture with AI-powered expense categorization
- **Background Processing**: Silent updates and sync when app not active

### AI Integration Strategy
- **Smart Categorization**: Expense and time entry classification using historical patterns
- **Predictive Analytics**: Project timeline and budget variance prediction
- **Quote Generation**: Historical project analysis with market rate integration
- **Natural Language**: Voice-to-text for field updates with construction terminology
- **Optimization Engine**: Resource allocation and scheduling recommendations
