# Task 008: Project Management Features & Gantt Charts

## Description

Develop comprehensive project management capabilities including interactive Gantt charts, time tracking, resource allocation, and expense management. This module will provide visual project planning tools, automated scheduling, dependency management, and real-time progress tracking integrated with the WebSocket engine for live collaboration.

The system will support multiple project methodologies (Waterfall, Agile, Hybrid) and provide powerful visualization tools for project managers and stakeholders to track progress, manage resources, and control budgets effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Interactive Gantt Charts
- [ ] Drag-and-drop task scheduling and duration adjustment
- [ ] Visual dependency links between tasks (FS, SS, FF, SF)
- [ ] Critical path highlighting and calculation
- [ ] Milestone markers and progress indicators
- [ ] Resource allocation visualization with overallocation warnings

### Project Planning & Scheduling
- [ ] Project templates for common project types
- [ ] Automatic scheduling based on dependencies and constraints
- [ ] Resource leveling and capacity planning
- [ ] Calendar integration with holidays and working hours
- [ ] What-if scenario planning and timeline simulation

### Time Tracking System
- [ ] Manual time entry with task association
- [ ] Timer-based time tracking with pause/resume
- [ ] Bulk time entry and approval workflows
- [ ] Integration with calendar applications
- [ ] Automated time suggestions based on activity patterns

### Expense Management
- [ ] Expense category management and budgeting
- [ ] Receipt capture and automatic categorization
- [ ] Multi-currency support with exchange rate handling
- [ ] Expense approval workflows and policy enforcement
- [ ] Integration with accounting systems for reimbursements

### Resource Management
- [ ] Team member skills and availability tracking
- [ ] Resource allocation optimization suggestions
- [ ] Workload balancing across projects
- [ ] Contractor and external resource management
- [ ] Equipment and asset allocation tracking

## Technical Details

### Gantt Chart Implementation
```typescript
interface GanttTask {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  duration: number;
  progress: number;
  dependencies: TaskDependency[];
  assignees: ResourceAllocation[];
  criticalPath: boolean;
}

interface TaskDependency {
  predecessorId: string;
  type: 'FS' | 'SS' | 'FF' | 'SF';
  lag: number;
}
```

### Real-time Collaboration Features
- Live cursor tracking for multi-user editing
- Real-time task updates and progress synchronization
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Activity feed with user attribution
- Comment threads on tasks and milestones

### Time Tracking Architecture
```typescript
interface TimeEntry {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  projectId: string;
  taskId?: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  description: string;
  billable: boolean;
  approved: boolean;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for large project timelines
- Lazy loading of project data and dependencies
- Optimistic updates with rollback capabilities
- Efficient data caching and invalidation strategies

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Task 8**: Real-time synchronization engine for live collaboration
- Chart.js or D3.js for Gantt chart visualization
- Date-fns or Moment.js for date manipulation
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching

### Data Dependencies
- User management system for resource allocation
- Calendar integration APIs (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- File storage system for document attachments
- Notification system for task assignments and deadlines

## Effort Estimate

**Total: 4-5 weeks (160-200 hours)**

### Breakdown:
- **Gantt Chart Engine** (1.5 weeks): Interactive chart, dependency management
- **Time Tracking System** (1 week): Timer implementation, data management
- **Resource Management** (1 week): Allocation algorithms, availability tracking
- **Expense Management** (1 week): Workflow implementation, approval system
- **Integration & Testing** (0.5-1 week): Real-time features, performance optimization

### Team Requirements:
- 1 Senior Frontend Developer (data visualization expertise)
- 1 Backend Developer (scheduling algorithms, data modeling)
- 1 UX Designer (project management workflows)
