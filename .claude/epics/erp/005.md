# Task 005: Native iOS Mobile App Foundation

## Description

Develop the native iOS mobile application using Swift/SwiftUI that serves as the primary field interface for construction workers and project managers. The app must function seamlessly offline with Core Data storage, provide location-based time tracking, and synchronize with the web platform when connectivity is available.

This mobile-first approach recognizes that construction sites often have limited internet connectivity, making offline capability essential for user adoption and productivity gains.

## Acceptance Criteria

### App Architecture & Setup
- [ ] Xcode project configured with Swift 5.9+ and SwiftUI
- [ ] iOS 16+ minimum deployment target with backwards compatibility
- [ ] Core Data stack implemented with CloudKit synchronization
- [ ] Background app refresh configured for silent data sync
- [ ] App Store Connect configuration for TestFlight distribution

### Offline-First Data Management
- [ ] Core Data model for projects, time entries, expenses, and photos
- [ ] Offline CRUD operations for all critical data types
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy for concurrent edits
- [ ] Data compression and optimization for storage efficiency
- [ ] Automatic sync queue with retry logic for failed uploads

### Location Services & Time Tracking
- [ ] GPS-based location validation with geofencing
- [ ] Automatic time tracking start/stop based on job site proximity
- [ ] Background location tracking with battery optimization
- [ ] Manual override capabilities for edge cases
- [ ] Location accuracy verification and error handling

### Camera Integration & Expense Management
- [ ] Native camera interface for progress photos and receipts
- [ ] Image compression and local storage optimization
- [ ] Photo metadata capture (GPS, timestamp, project association)
- [ ] Expense entry with camera-captured receipt processing
- [ ] Offline photo queue with background upload

### User Interface & Experience
- [ ] SwiftUI design system matching web platform branding
- [ ] Dark mode support with automatic system detection
- [ ] Accessibility features including VoiceOver support
- [ ] Haptic feedback for important user interactions
- [ ] Offline indicator and connectivity status display

### Synchronization & Real-time Updates
- [ ] Background sync manager with exponential backoff
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket connection when online
- [ ] Push notification handling for urgent updates
- [ ] Sync progress indicators and error messaging
- [ ] Bandwidth-aware sync (WiFi vs cellular optimization)

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+ with strict typing
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with UIKit integration where needed
- **Data Storage**: Core Data with CloudKit for cloud sync
- **Networking**: URLSession with custom networking layer
- **Image Processing**: Core Image for compression and optimization
- **Location**: Core Location with region monitoring
- **Background Processing**: Background App Refresh and silent notifications

### App Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels handle business logic and data binding
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access layer abstracting Core Data operations
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Navigation management and deep linking
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocol-based dependency management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with user-friendly messages

### Core Data Schema
```
Project
├── id: UUID
├── name: String
├── address: String
├── coordinates: CLLocationCoordinate2D
├── startDate: Date
├── endDate: Date?
└── timeEntries: [TimeEntry]

TimeEntry
├── id: UUID
├── startTime: Date
├── endTime: Date?
├── location: CLLocationCoordinate2D
├── accuracy: Double

Expense
├── id: UUID
├── amount: Decimal
├── category: String
├── date: Date
├── receipt: Data?
├── location: CLLocationCoordinate2D?
└── project: Project
```

### Location Services Implementation
- **Geofencing**: 100-meter radius around job sites for automatic tracking
- **Battery Optimization**: Significant location changes only when app backgrounded
- **Accuracy Validation**: GPS accuracy requirements and fallback strategies
- **Privacy Compliance**: Clear user consent and data usage explanation

### Offline Storage Strategy
- **Local-First**: All operations work offline, sync is enhancement
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with manual resolution for important conflicts
- **Storage Limits**: Intelligent data purging for older, synced entries
- **Encryption**: Core Data encryption for sensitive business information

## Dependencies

### Required Completion
- **Task 002**: Database Schema & Authentication must be completed
- API endpoints for mobile authentication and data synchronization
- WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
- Push notification service configuration

### External Dependencies
- Apple Developer Program membership and certificates
- Push notification certificates and configuration
- App Store Connect access for TestFlight distribution
- iOS development machine (macOS with Xcode)

### Integration Dependencies
- Backend API must support mobile-optimized endpoints
- Image upload service for photo synchronization
- Location validation service for time tracking verification
- Push notification service for real-time alerts

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort**: 8 weeks (320 hours)

### Week-by-week Breakdown
- **Week 1**: Xcode setup, Core Data model, basic app structure (40 hours)
- **Week 2**: Offline data layer, CRUD operations, local storage (40 hours)
- **Week 3**: Location services, geofencing, time tracking automation (40 hours)
- **Week 4**: Camera integration, photo management, expense entry (40 hours)
- **Week 5**: SwiftUI interface, navigation, accessibility features (40 hours)
- **Week 6**: Synchronization engine, conflict resolution, background processing (40 hours)
- **Week 7**: Real-time updates, push notifications, performance optimization (40 hours)
- **Week 8**: Testing, debugging, TestFlight preparation, documentation (40 hours)

### Parallel Development
- UI components can be developed while data layer is being built
- Location services can be implemented alongside camera integration
- Synchronization logic can be developed parallel to offline functionality
