# Task: AI Integration Engine & Gemini API

## Description

Implement the core AI integration engine using Google Gemini API to power smart categorization, predictive analytics, and automated decision-making throughout the ERP system. This includes building prompt engineering frameworks, response caching, context management, and AI-powered features for expense categorization, time allocation suggestions, and project optimization.

The AI engine will serve as the intelligence layer that reduces administrative burden by 70% through automated categorization and smart recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Gemini API integration with authentication and rate limiting
- [ ] Prompt engineering framework with template management
- [ ] Smart expense categorization with 90%+ accuracy
- [ ] Time allocation suggestions for project phases
- [ ] Context management for AI memory and project patterns
- [ ] Response caching to optimize API usage and costs
- [ ] Error handling and fallback mechanisms for AI failures
- [ ] Voice-to-text integration for field updates
- [ ] Construction-specific terminology and keyword recognition
- [ ] AI performance monitoring and accuracy tracking

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **AI Service**: Dedicated microservice for all AI operations
- **API Integration**: Google Gemini API with proper error handling
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for response caching and context storage
- **Prompt Management**: Template system for consistent AI interactions
- **Vector Storage**: Pinecone/Chroma for AI memory and pattern recognition

### Key Features to Build
- Expense photo analysis and automatic categorization
- Time entry suggestions based on project phase and history
- Natural language processing for construction terminology
- Project timeline risk assessment and early warning system
- Resource allocation optimization recommendations
- Quote generation based on historical project data

### Code Locations
- `/src/services/ai/` - Core AI service implementation
- `/src/lib/gemini/` - Gemini API client and utilities
- `/src/prompts/` - AI prompt templates and management
- `/src/types/ai.ts` - TypeScript types for AI responses
- `/src/middleware/ai-cache.ts` - Response caching middleware

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 4: Core Backend API Services (for service infrastructure)
- [ ] Google Gemini API access and authentication setup
- [ ] Vector database setup (Pinecone or Chroma)
- [ ] Construction domain knowledge for prompt engineering
- [ ] Historical project data for training patterns

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: Large (L)
- **Hours**: 72 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent AI service)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Gemini API integration and authentication: 12 hours
  - Prompt engineering and template system: 16 hours
  - Smart categorization implementation: 16 hours
  - Voice-to-text and NLP features: 12 hours
  - Caching and performance optimization: 8 hours
  - Testing and accuracy validation: 8 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] AI service deployed with proper error handling
- [ ] 90%+ accuracy achieved for expense categorization
- [ ] Voice-to-text functionality tested on construction terminology
- [ ] Response caching implemented with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard for AI operations
- [ ] Integration tests covering all AI features
- [ ] Documentation for prompt templates and AI workflows
- [ ] Cost monitoring for Gemini API usage
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms tested for AI service failures
- [ ] Code reviewed and security validated
