# Task: Docker Container Definitions

## Description
Create comprehensive Docker container definitions for the complete SPICE-ERPNext stack, including all necessary services for development, testing, and production environments. This establishes the foundation for local deployment with proper service orchestration, health monitoring, and network isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] docker-compose.yml with ERPNext, MariaDB, Redis, and SPICE services
- [ ] Container health checks for all critical services
- [ ] Proper networking configuration with service isolation
- [ ] Volume mounts for data persistence and development
- [ ] Environment-specific variants (dev/test/prod)
- [ ] Resource limits and scaling configurations
- [ ] Service dependency management and startup ordering

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Multi-service Docker Compose setup
- Key considerations:
  - ERPNext base image selection and customization
  - MariaDB configuration for ERPNext compatibility
  - Redis caching layer integration
  - SPICE service container definitions
  - Network security and inter-service communication
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/docker/docker-compose.yml` (main orchestration)
  - `/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` (development overrides)
  - `/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` (production configuration)
  - `/docker/Dockerfile.spice` (SPICE service container)
  - `/docker/config/` (service configuration templates)

## Dependencies
- [ ] No task dependencies (foundational)
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose availability
- [ ] Base ERPNext container image access
- [ ] SPICE service requirements specification

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with complete docker-compose configuration
- [ ] Tests written for container startup and health checks
- [ ] Documentation updated with deployment instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed for security and best practices
- [ ] Validated across development and production scenarios
