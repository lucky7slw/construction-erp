# Task: Deployment Orchestrator

## Description
Create a comprehensive deployment orchestration system that executes real-time deployment with progress tracking, manages container lifecycle and monitoring, orchestrates Docker compose deployments with live status updates, and implements service health monitoring with auto-recovery capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time deployment execution with progress tracking and streaming logs
- [ ] Container lifecycle management (start, stop, restart, remove)
- [ ] Docker compose deployment orchestration with service dependency handling
- [ ] Live status updates with WebSocket or SSE for UI integration
- [ ] Service health monitoring with configurable check intervals
- [ ] Auto-recovery mechanisms for failed services
- [ ] Deployment rollback capabilities for critical failures
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring and alerting

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Python orchestration engine with Docker SDK integration
- Key considerations:
  - Docker SDK for programmatic container management
  - Async/await patterns for concurrent deployment operations
  - WebSocket server for real-time status broadcasting
  - Health check orchestration with retry logic
  - Service dependency graph resolution
  - Resource monitoring with system metrics collection
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/orchestrator/deployment.py` (main deployment orchestrator)
  - `/orchestrator/lifecycle.py` (container lifecycle management)
  - `/orchestrator/monitoring.py` (health checks and auto-recovery)
  - `/orchestrator/status.py` (real-time status tracking)
  - `/orchestrator/recovery.py` (failure detection and recovery)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 14 (Docker Container Definitions) - needs container configurations
- [ ] Task 16 (Configuration Wizard Framework) - needs deployment configurations
- [ ] Docker SDK for Python
- [ ] WebSocket framework (asyncio-based)
- [ ] System monitoring libraries (psutil)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with complete orchestration workflow
- [ ] Tests written for deployment scenarios, health checks, and recovery
- [ ] Documentation updated with orchestration API and usage patterns
- [ ] Code reviewed for reliability, error handling, and performance
- [ ] Validated with complex multi-service deployment scenarios
- [ ] Load tested for concurrent deployment and monitoring operations
