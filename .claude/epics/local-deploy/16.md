# Task: Configuration Wizard Framework

## Description
Develop an interactive CLI configuration wizard that guides users through SPICE-ERPNext deployment setup, collecting necessary parameters and generating customized docker-compose configurations. The wizard should provide intelligent defaults while allowing advanced users to override settings as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive CLI wizard using click framework
- [ ] Multi-step configuration flow with input validation
- [ ] Template-based docker-compose.yml generation from user inputs
- [ ] Smart defaults based on system detection and best practices
- [ ] Configuration persistence and modification capabilities
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration profiles (dev/test/prod)
- [ ] Validation of configuration before deployment

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Click-based Python CLI with Jinja2 templates
- Key considerations:
  - User experience design for technical and non-technical users
  - Input validation for ports, passwords, URLs, and file paths
  - Template engine for docker-compose generation
  - Configuration file management and version control
  - Integration with Docker container definitions from Task 14
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/config/wizard.py` (main configuration wizard)
  - `/config/templates/` (docker-compose and config templates)
  - `/config/profiles/` (predefined configuration profiles)
  - `/config/validation.py` (input validation logic)
  - `/config/generator.py` (template processing engine)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 14 (Docker Container Definitions) - needs container templates
- [ ] Click framework for CLI interface
- [ ] Jinja2 template engine
- [ ] YAML processing libraries

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with complete wizard workflow
- [ ] Tests written for configuration generation and validation
- [ ] Documentation updated with wizard usage examples
- [ ] Code reviewed for user experience and error handling
- [ ] Validated with various configuration scenarios and user inputs
