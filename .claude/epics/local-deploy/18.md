# Task: Validation Framework

## Description
Develop a comprehensive post-deployment validation framework that performs automated testing of SPICE module functionality, validates API endpoints and health checks, establishes performance baselines, and ensures deployment integrity through systematic verification procedures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Post-deployment comprehensive testing suite with automated execution
- [ ] SPICE module functionality validation across all core features
- [ ] API endpoint testing with authentication and authorization validation
- [ ] Database connectivity and data integrity verification
- [ ] Service health checks with dependency validation
- [ ] Performance baseline validation and regression detection
- [ ] Integration testing between ERPNext and SPICE components
- [ ] Rollback trigger mechanisms for critical validation failures

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: pytest-based validation framework with custom fixtures
- Key considerations:
  - Automated test discovery and execution pipeline
  - API endpoint validation with comprehensive request/response testing
  - Database schema and data integrity verification
  - Performance metrics collection and baseline comparison
  - SPICE-specific functionality testing (auth, AI features, etc.)
  - Integration test scenarios between services
  - Test result reporting with actionable failure details
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/validation/framework.py` (main validation orchestrator)
  - `/validation/tests/` (test suites for different components)
  - `/validation/api_tests.py` (API endpoint validation)
  - `/validation/performance.py` (performance baseline testing)
  - `/validation/spice_tests.py` (SPICE module specific tests)
  - `/validation/integration_tests.py` (cross-service integration tests)
  - `/validation/reporters.py` (test result reporting and formatting)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 17 (Deployment Orchestrator) - needs deployed services to validate
- [ ] pytest framework with async support
- [ ] API testing libraries (httpx, requests)
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools
- [ ] Database testing utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18-22
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive validation test suite
- [ ] Tests written for validation framework components and edge cases
- [ ] Documentation updated with validation procedures and test coverage
- [ ] Code reviewed for test reliability and comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Validated across multiple deployment scenarios and configurations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for regression detection
