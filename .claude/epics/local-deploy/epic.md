# Epic: local-deploy

## Overview

Implement a Docker-first, one-command deployment system for SPICE-ERPNext that automatically installs prerequisites, guides users through configuration with a definitive wizard, and deploys a fully validated containerized environment. The system leverages existing SPICE integration and focuses on eliminating deployment friction through intelligent automation and containerization.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Choices
- **Python CLI Framework**: Use `click` for cross-platform CLI with progress bars and interactive prompts
- **Docker Deployment**: Primary deployment via docker-compose with multi-service orchestration
- **Platform Detection**: Leverage `platform` module with fallback detection for distribution-specific handling
- **Package Managers**: Platform-specific installers (Windows: winget/chocolatey, macOS: homebrew, Linux: apt/yum)
- **Configuration Engine**: Jinja2 templates for docker-compose.yml and environment file generation

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Platform-specific installation strategies (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Builder Pattern**: Configuration wizard builds complete deployment configuration step-by-step
- **Template Method**: Common deployment flow with platform-specific implementations
- **Observer Pattern**: Progress tracking and real-time status updates during deployment

### Leverage Existing SPICE Infrastructure
- **Reuse SPICE containers**: Extend existing Docker configurations rather than rebuild
- **Integrate validation systems**: Use existing SPICE health check and API testing frameworks
- **Extend configuration**: Build on existing SPICE Configuration DocType for settings management

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Interactive CLI Wizard**: Multi-step configuration wizard with validation and preview
- **Progress Display**: Real-time progress bars, status indicators, and deployment logs
- **Error Display**: Clear error messages with suggested remediation steps
- **Success Dashboard**: Post-deployment summary with access URLs and credentials

### Backend Services
- **Prerequisite Detector**: Cross-platform detection of Docker, Git, and other dependencies
- **Auto-Installer Engine**: Platform-specific automated installation with privilege handling
- **Configuration Generator**: Template-based generation of docker-compose.yml and environment files
- **Deployment Orchestrator**: Container lifecycle management with health monitoring
- **Validation Suite**: Comprehensive testing of deployed services and SPICE modules

### Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose Stack**: Multi-container orchestration for ERPNext, SPICE, databases, and services
- **Container Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring and auto-recovery mechanisms
- **Volume Management**: Persistent data storage and backup-ready volume structure
- **Network Isolation**: Secure container networking with exposed ports only as needed

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
- **Start with existing deployment scripts**: Enhance `deploy_spice_local.py` and `quick_deploy.py` as foundation
- **Containerize incrementally**: Build Docker configurations for each SPICE component
- **Test platform-by-platform**: Validate on Windows, macOS, Linux in parallel development
- **User feedback integration**: Early prototype testing with actual deployment scenarios

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Native deployment option when Docker unavailable or fails
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting deployment issues
- **Rollback capabilities**: Ability to cleanly remove failed deployments
- **Offline mode**: Support for environments with limited internet connectivity

### Testing Strategy
- **Automated platform testing**: CI pipeline testing on multiple OS versions
- **Container integration testing**: Validate all service interactions within containers
- **Performance benchmarking**: Ensure deployment meets <15 minute requirement
- **Error scenario testing**: Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:

- [ ] **Docker Foundation**: Create docker-compose stack, container definitions, and orchestration logic
- [ ] **Auto-Installer Engine**: Build cross-platform prerequisite detection and automated installation
- [ ] **Configuration Wizard**: Implement interactive CLI wizard with validation and template generation
- [ ] **Deployment Orchestrator**: Real-time deployment execution with progress tracking and error handling
- [ ] **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive post-deployment testing and health monitoring
- [ ] **Platform Integration**: Windows/macOS/Linux specific optimizations and testing
- [ ] **Documentation & Polish**: User experience improvements, help system, and deployment guides
- [ ] **Error Recovery System**: Automated error detection, recovery, and rollback mechanisms

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Docker Engine**: Required for containerized deployment (auto-installed by system)
- **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration (bundled with Docker Desktop, separate install for Linux)
- **Git**: Repository operations (auto-installed by system)
- **Platform Package Managers**: winget/chocolatey (Windows), homebrew (macOS), apt/yum (Linux)

### Internal Dependencies
- **Existing SPICE Integration**: Builds on completed SPICE-ERPNext integration
- **SPICE Docker Containers**: Requires containerized versions of SPICE modules
- **Configuration Templates**: Needs production-ready docker-compose and environment templates
- **Health Check APIs**: Leverages existing SPICE health check and monitoring APIs

### Prerequisite Work
- **Container Registry Setup**: Host for SPICE-ERPNext container images
- **Template Validation**: Verify docker-compose templates work across platforms
- **Security Review**: Validate automated installation security practices

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Total Deployment Time**: <15 minutes on modern hardware (target: <10 minutes)
- **Container Startup**: All services healthy within 2 minutes of deployment completion
- **Resource Usage**: <4GB RAM for development mode, <8GB for production mode
- **Network Performance**: API endpoints responding <500ms after deployment

### Quality Gates
- **Platform Success Rate**: 100% success on Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+
- **First-Attempt Success**: 95% deployments succeed without manual intervention
- **Error Recovery**: 90% of common errors automatically resolved
- **Validation Coverage**: 100% of critical SPICE functions validated post-deployment

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Zero Manual Configuration**: No requirement to edit configuration files manually
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All SPICE APIs, modules, and integrations tested automatically
- **Clear Error Handling**: Actionable error messages with suggested fixes
- **Professional Documentation**: Auto-generated deployment reports and troubleshooting guides

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
- **8 weeks total development time**
- **4 weeks MVP** (Docker foundation, basic wizard, deployment orchestration)
- **4 weeks full features** (advanced validation, error recovery, platform optimization)

### Resource Requirements
- **2 Backend Developers**: Core deployment engine and Docker orchestration
- **1 DevOps Engineer**: Container definitions, CI/CD, platform testing
- **1 UI/UX Developer**: CLI wizard experience and error handling UX

### Critical Path Items
1. **Docker Container Creation** (Week 1-2): Foundation for entire system
2. **Cross-Platform Auto-Installation** (Week 2-3): Enables prerequisite automation
3. **Configuration Wizard** (Week 3-4): Core user interaction component
4. **Deployment Orchestration** (Week 4-5): Brings all components together
5. **Comprehensive Testing** (Week 6-8): Ensures reliability across platforms

### Milestone Delivery
- **Week 2**: Docker foundation with basic deployment
