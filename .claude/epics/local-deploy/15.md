# Task: Auto-Installation Engine

## Description
Build a cross-platform automated installation system that detects system prerequisites, installs missing dependencies, and handles platform-specific requirements for SPICE-ERPNext deployment. The engine should provide a seamless one-command installation experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-platform prerequisite detection (Docker, Git, Python, Node.js)
- [ ] Automated installation via native package managers (winget, homebrew, apt/yum)
- [ ] Privilege escalation handling with user consent
- [ ] Installation progress tracking and error recovery
- [ ] Platform-specific installation scripts (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- [ ] Verification of installed components and versions
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed installations

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Python-based installer with platform detection
- Key considerations:
  - Windows: winget, chocolatey, or direct installer downloads
  - macOS: homebrew integration and system preferences
  - Linux: apt/yum/dnf package manager detection
  - Docker Desktop vs Docker Engine installation paths
  - User permission handling and sudo/admin prompts
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/install/installer.py` (main installation engine)
  - `/install/platforms/` (platform-specific modules)
  - `/install/requirements.json` (prerequisite definitions)
  - `/install.sh` and `/install.bat` (entry point scripts)

## Dependencies
- [ ] No task dependencies (independent implementation)
- [ ] Platform-specific package manager APIs
- [ ] Docker installation packages and repositories
- [ ] Python packaging and distribution setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18-24
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full cross-platform support
- [ ] Tests written for each platform and installation scenario
- [ ] Documentation updated with installation troubleshooting
- [ ] Code reviewed for security and privilege handling
- [ ] Validated on fresh Windows, macOS, and Linux systems
