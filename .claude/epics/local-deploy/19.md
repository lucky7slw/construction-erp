# Task: Error Recovery System

## Description
Implement a robust error recovery system that provides automated error detection and recovery mechanisms, rollback capabilities for failed deployments, comprehensive error logging and reporting, and user-friendly error messages with clear remediation steps for operational resilience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated error detection across all deployment phases
- [ ] Intelligent recovery strategies with escalation paths
- [ ] Automatic rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging with structured metadata
- [ ] Error categorization and severity classification
- [ ] User-friendly error messages with actionable remediation steps
- [ ] Recovery state persistence and resumption capabilities
- [ ] Integration with monitoring systems for proactive error detection

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: State machine-based recovery system with pluggable strategies
- Key considerations:
  - Error detection patterns across different failure modes
  - Recovery strategy selection based on error type and context
  - Rollback mechanisms preserving data integrity
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs and context preservation
  - Error message templating for user-friendly communication
  - State persistence for recovery operation resumption
  - Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/recovery/system.py` (main error recovery orchestrator)
  - `/recovery/detection.py` (error detection and classification)
  - `/recovery/strategies.py` (recovery strategy implementations)
  - `/recovery/rollback.py` (deployment rollback mechanisms)
  - `/recovery/logging.py` (structured error logging and reporting)
  - `/recovery/messages.py` (user-friendly error message templates)
  - `/recovery/state.py` (recovery state management and persistence)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 17 (Deployment Orchestrator) - needs deployment context and hooks
- [ ] Structured logging libraries
- [ ] State management persistence layer
- [ ] Error monitoring and alerting integrations

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 14-18
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive error recovery workflows
- [ ] Tests written for error scenarios, recovery strategies, and rollback procedures
- [ ] Documentation updated with error recovery procedures and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Code reviewed for reliability, error handling completeness, and user experience
- [ ] Validated with induced failure scenarios and recovery testing
- [ ] Integration tested with monitoring and alerting systems
