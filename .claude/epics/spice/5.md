## Overview

Develop a comprehensive GPS-tagged photo management system with mobile-optimized capture interface, designed for construction site documentation and seamless integration with ERPNext's file attachment system and SPICE AI analysis pipeline.

## Objectives

- Mobile-first photo capture interface optimized for construction site conditions
- Automatic GPS tagging and metadata extraction for site documentation
- Efficient photo storage and organization within ERPNext framework
- Foundation for AI-powered analysis and progress tracking

## Technical Details

### Mobile Photo Capture Interface
- **Touch-Optimized UI**: Large capture buttons and gesture controls for gloved hands
- **Camera Integration**: High-resolution capture with manual focus override options
- **Offline Capability**: Queue photos for upload when connectivity returns
- **Quick Categorization**: One-tap tagging for common photo types (progress, safety, materials)

### GPS and Metadata System
- **Precise Location Tagging**: GPS coordinates with accuracy indicators
- **Site Zone Mapping**: Automatic detection of project areas and building sections
- **Timestamp Integration**: Server-synchronized time with timezone handling
- **Device Information**: Camera specs, orientation, and environmental data

### Storage Architecture
- **ERPNext File Integration**: Seamless integration with existing file attachment system
- **Cloud Storage Options**: Support for S3, Google Cloud, and local storage backends
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression and thumbnail generation
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple photo uploads
