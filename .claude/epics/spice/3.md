## Overview

Create custom ERPNext DocTypes to support SPICE construction project management and AI-powered site analysis, extending the ERPNext framework with specialized data structures for construction industry workflows.

## Objectives

- Design and implement SPICEProject DocType for construction project management
- Create SPICESitePhoto DocType for site documentation and AI analysis
- Develop SPICEAIAnalysis DocType for storing and tracking AI insights
- Integrate seamlessly with existing ERPNext framework and workflows

## Technical Details

### SPICEProject DocType
- **Purpose**: Central management of construction projects with SPICE-specific fields
- **Key Fields**: Project timeline, safety requirements, compliance standards, stakeholder info
- **Relationships**: Links to ERPNext Project, Customer, and Item DocTypes
- **Workflows**: Approval processes for project milestones and safety compliance

### SPICESitePhoto DocType
- **Purpose**: Store and categorize construction site photographs for AI analysis
- **Key Fields**: Photo metadata, location data, timestamp, category tags, analysis status
- **File Handling**: Integration with ERPNext file attachment system
- **AI Integration**: Hooks for triggering AI analysis on photo upload

### SPICEAIAnalysis DocType
- **Purpose**: Store AI-generated insights, safety assessments, and progress reports
- **Key Fields**: Analysis type, confidence scores, recommendations, risk assessments
- **Data Structure**: Flexible JSON fields for varying AI response formats
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of AI analyses and human reviews

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: DocType Creation
1. Design data models and field structures for all three DocTypes
2. Create DocType definitions using ERPNext Developer Mode
3. Set up proper field types, validations, and mandatory requirements
4. Configure initial permissions and role assignments

### Phase 2: Relationships and Workflows
1. Establish relationships between DocTypes and existing ERPNext modules
2. Create custom workflows for project approval and AI analysis review
3. Implement business logic through server scripts and hooks
4. Set up automated notifications and alerts

### Phase 3: User Interface and Integration
1. Design custom forms and list views for optimal user experience
2. Create dashboard cards and reports for project monitoring
3. Implement search functionality and custom filters
4. Add mobile-optimized views for field data collection

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema

- [x] Documentation covers DocType usage and customization
- [x] Code review completed with ERPNext best practices verified

## Data Migration Strategy

### New Installation
- Clean DocType installation with sample data
- Default permissions and role assignments
- Template projects and photo categories

### Existing ERPNext Instances
- Migration scripts for data transformation
- Backup and rollback procedures
- Incremental deployment strategy
- User training and change management

## Security Considerations

- File upload restrictions and validation
- Data encryption for sensitive AI analysis results
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- GDPR compliance for personal data handling

## Success Metrics

- DocType creation time: < 2 seconds for form loads
- Search performance: < 1 second for filtered results
- File upload speed: < 30 seconds for 10MB photos
- User adoption: Positive feedback from initial user testing
- Data integrity: Zero data loss during migration testing
