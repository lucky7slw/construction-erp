## Overview

Establish the foundational AI service infrastructure for SPICE with Google Gemini API integration, implementing robust fallback mechanisms and caching strategies to ensure reliable AI-powered construction site analysis.

## Objectives

- Core Google Gemini API integration with proper authentication
- Service architecture with circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Redis caching layer for AI response optimization
- Foundation for all AI-powered features in SPICE

## Technical Details

### AI Service Architecture
- **Primary Provider**: Google Gemini Pro Vision API for image analysis
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Queue-based retry system with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures with configurable thresholds
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement API quota management and request throttling

### Redis Caching Strategy
- **Response Caching**: Cache AI analysis results with TTL based on content type
- **Image Fingerprinting**: Use perceptual hashing to avoid duplicate analyses
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart invalidation based on project context changes
- **Performance Metrics**: Track cache hit rates and response times

### Integration Points
- **ERPNext Framework**: Service layer integration with Frappe architecture
- **Background Jobs**: Async processing for large image batches
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics collection

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **API Integration**
   - [x] Google Gemini API client configured with proper authentication
   - [x] Request/response handling for image analysis endpoints
   - [x] Support for batch processing of multiple images
   - [x] Proper error handling for API failures and rate limits

2. **Resilience Patterns**
   - [x] Circuit breaker implementation with configurable failure thresholds
   - [x] Exponential backoff retry mechanism for transient failures
   - [x] Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
   - [x] Queue-based processing for handling peak loads

3. **Caching Implementation**
   - [x] Redis integration with connection pooling
   - [x] Intelligent cache key generation based on image content
   - [x] TTL management for different types of AI responses
   - [x] Cache warming strategies for frequently accessed data

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - [x] Comprehensive logging for all AI service interactions
   - [x] Performance metrics tracking (latency, throughput, errors)
   - [x] Health check endpoints for service monitoring
   - [x] Alert mechanisms for service degradation

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core API Integration
1. Set up Google Gemini API credentials and authentication
2. Implement base AI service class with request/response handling
3. Create image preprocessing pipeline for optimal API consumption
4. Add basic error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Resilience Layer
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern using proven libraries
2. Add retry mechanisms with configurable backoff strategies
3. Create service health monitoring and failure detection
4. Implement graceful degradation modes

### Phase 3: Caching & Performance
1. Set up Redis connection and connection pooling
2. Implement cache key generation with image fingerprinting
3. Add cache warming and invalidation strategies
4. Performance optimization and load testing

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Google Generative AI Python SDK
- Redis server and redis-py client
- Circuit breaker library (e.g., pybreaker)
- Image processing libraries (Pillow, opencv-python)

### Configuration
- Environment-based configuration for API keys and endpoints
- Configurable timeouts, retry counts, and circuit breaker thresholds
- Redis connection settings and cache TTL configurations
- Logging levels and output destinations

### Security Considerations
- Secure storage of API keys using environment variables
- Input validation for all image uploads and parameters
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect quotas
- Audit logging for AI service usage tracking

## Definition of Done

- [x] AI service foundation is fully implemented and tested
- [x] All acceptance criteria are met with comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- [x] Performance benchmarks meet specified requirements
- [x] Documentation covers API usage, configuration, and troubleshooting
- [x] Code review completed and security review passed
- [x] Service monitoring is operational with alerts configured

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Quota Exhaustion**: Implement intelligent request batching and caching
- **Service Availability**: Multiple fallback strategies and circuit breakers
- **Performance Degradation**: Caching layer and async processing queues
- **Cost Management**: Usage tracking and automatic budget controls

## Success Metrics

- API response time: < 2 seconds for single image analysis
- Cache hit rate: > 80% for repeated similar analyses
- Service uptime: > 99.5% availability
- Error rate: < 1% of total requests fail permanently
