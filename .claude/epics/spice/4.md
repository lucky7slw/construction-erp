## Overview

Implement comprehensive security and authentication framework for SPICE, ensuring secure API access, data protection for AI transmissions, and establishing SOC 2 compliance foundations for enterprise deployment.

## Objectives

- OAuth 2.0 implementation for secure API access and third-party integrations
- End-to-end encryption for AI data transmissions and sensitive information
- Security compliance framework with SOC 2 Type I preparation
- Audit logging and security monitoring for all system interactions

## Technical Details

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication
- **Authorization Server**: ERPNext-integrated OAuth provider
- **Supported Flows**: Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password
- **Token Management**: JWT-based access and refresh tokens with configurable TTL
- **Scope Management**: Granular permissions for API endpoints and resources

### Data Encryption Strategy
- **In-Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications with perfect forward secrecy
- **At-Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data in database and file storage
- **AI Transmissions**: End-to-end encryption for image data sent to AI services
- **Key Management**: Hardware security module (HSM) or cloud-based key vault

### Security Compliance Framework
- **SOC 2 Type I Preparation**: Control environment and system descriptions
- **Access Controls**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based permissions
- **Data Protection**: Privacy controls and data retention policies
- **Incident Response**: Security monitoring and automated threat detection

   - [x] Database field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - [x] File encryption for uploaded photos and documents
   - [x] Secure key generation, rotation, and storage procedures
   - [x] Performance optimization to minimize encryption overhead

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - [x] Comprehensive audit logging for all authentication events
   - [x] Real-time security monitoring with anomaly detection
   - [x] Failed authentication attempt tracking and alerting
   - [x] Session management with automatic timeout and cleanup
   - [x] Security headers and CSRF protection implementation

4. **Compliance Framework**
   - [x] SOC 2 control documentation and evidence collection
   - [x] Data classification and handling procedures
   - [x] Privacy policy and consent management system
   - [x] Incident response procedures and escalation protocols
   - [x] Regular security assessment and penetration testing framework

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: OAuth 2.0 Foundation
1. Set up OAuth 2.0 authorization server using proven libraries
2. Implement client registration and credential management
3. Create token generation and validation mechanisms
4. Add OAuth endpoint security and rate limiting

### Phase 2: Encryption Infrastructure
1. Implement TLS 1.3 configuration and certificate management
2. Set up database encryption for sensitive fields
3. Create file encryption pipeline for photo uploads
4. Establish key management and rotation procedures

### Phase 3: Security Monitoring & Compliance
1. Implement comprehensive audit logging system
2. Set up security monitoring and alerting infrastructure
3. Create SOC 2 control documentation and evidence collection
4. Establish incident response procedures and testing protocols

## Technical Requirements

### OAuth 2.0 Dependencies
- PyJWT for JWT token handling
- Authlib for OAuth 2.0 server implementation
- Redis for token storage and session management
- Rate limiting middleware for API protection

### Encryption Requirements
- Cryptography library for AES encryption
- TLS certificate management (Let's Encrypt integration)
- Hardware security module or cloud key vault
- Performance monitoring for encryption overhead

### Monitoring and Logging
- Structured logging with JSON format
- Log aggregation and analysis tools
- Real-time alerting system
- Security information and event management (SIEM) integration

## Definition of Done

- [x] OAuth 2.0 server is fully functional with all supported flows
- [x] Encryption is implemented for all sensitive data paths
- [x] Security monitoring captures all relevant events
- [x] SOC 2 Type I documentation is complete and reviewed
- [x] Penetration testing reveals no critical vulnerabilities
- [x] Performance impact of security measures is within acceptable limits
- [x] Security procedures are documented and team is trained
- [x] Compliance audit readiness verified by third-party assessor

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. **User Authentication**: ERPNext SSO with optional MFA
2. **API Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with scoped access tokens
3. **Service Authentication**: Mutual TLS for internal service communication
4. **AI Service Authentication**: Encrypted API keys with rotation

### Data Classification
- **Public**: General project information and non-sensitive metadata
- **Internal**: Project details and non-critical analysis results
- **Confidential**: Personal data, financial information, detailed AI insights
- **Restricted**: Security credentials, encryption keys, compliance data

### Threat Modeling
- **External Threats**: API attacks, data interception, credential theft
- **Internal Threats**: Privilege escalation, data exfiltration, insider threats
- **Infrastructure Threats**: Cloud security, network attacks, physical access
- **Supply Chain Threats**: Third-party dependencies, AI service compromise

## Compliance Requirements

### SOC 2 Type I Controls
- **Security**: Logical and physical access controls
- **Availability**: System uptime and disaster recovery
- **Processing Integrity**: Data accuracy and completeness
- **Confidentiality**: Data protection and encryption
- **Privacy**: Personal data handling and consent management

### Industry Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security best practices
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy requirements
- **CCPA**: California consumer privacy compliance

## Risk Mitigation

- **Authentication Bypass**: Multi-layered authentication with monitoring
- **Data Breaches**: End-to-end encryption and access controls
- **API Abuse**: Rate limiting and behavioral analysis
- **Insider Threats**: Least privilege access and audit trails
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Dependency scanning and verification

## Success Metrics

- **Authentication Success Rate**: > 99.9% for legitimate users
- **Token Validation Time**: < 100ms average response time
- **Encryption Performance**: < 10% overhead on system performance
- **Security Event Detection**: < 5 minutes for critical incidents
- **Compliance Score**: 100% pass rate on SOC 2 Type I audit
