# Epic: SPICE - Smart Project Intelligence & Construction Enterprise

## Overview

SPICE represents the revolutionary integration of ERPNext's proven ERP foundation, HHHomesProject's construction-specific UI innovation, and Google Gemini AI's advanced intelligence capabilities into the world's first comprehensive AI-powered construction ERP platform. This epic focuses on creating a unified system that leverages existing ERPNext capabilities while adding construction-specific workflows and AI-driven insights to transform how construction companies operate, predict, and succeed.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Integration Strategy
- **Microservices Architecture**: Isolate AI services from core ERP functions to prevent system instability
- **ERPNext Foundation**: Leverage existing Frappe framework and DocType system for proven scalability
- **AI Service Layer**: Create abstraction layer for Google Gemini integration with fallback mechanisms
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build on ERPNext's existing modules rather than replacing core functionality

### Technology Choices
- **Backend**: ERPNext/Frappe Framework with Python 3.11+ for AI service integration
- **Database**: Enhanced ERPNext schema with construction-specific fields and AI analysis storage
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini Vision API and NLP engine with local processing for sensitive data
- **Frontend**: Enhanced Frappe UI with React components for complex AI features
- **Caching**: Redis for AI response caching and real-time collaboration
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with GraphQL for complex queries, WebSocket for real-time updates

### Design Patterns
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Separate AI, construction, and core ERP services
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read/write operations for performance
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time updates for construction site changes and AI analysis
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent AI service failures from affecting core ERP functionality

## Technical Approach
