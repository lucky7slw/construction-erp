## Objective

Implement WebSocket-based real-time collaboration infrastructure that enables instant updates and synchronization across multi-user construction workflows, ensuring seamless data sharing between mobile field workers and desktop project managers.

## Context

Construction projects require real-time coordination between field teams, supervisors, and office staff. Workers need immediate visibility into changes, updates, and new assignments, while managers need live project status. Current batch-update systems create delays that impact project efficiency and safety coordination.

## User Stories

### Primary Stories
- **Field Worker**: Instantly see new task assignments and priority changes while on-site
- **Site Supervisor**: Real-time visibility when workers complete tasks or encounter issues
- **Project Manager**: Live dashboard updates as field conditions and progress change
- **Safety Coordinator**: Immediate notifications of safety incidents or equipment issues

### Secondary Stories
- **Materials Manager**: Real-time inventory updates as materials are consumed
- **Quality Inspector**: Instant notifications when inspections are requested
- **Scheduler**: Live updates to resource allocation and timeline adjustments
- **Client Representative**: Real-time project progress visibility

## Technical Requirements

### Core WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Bi-directional Communication**: Full-duplex real-time data exchange
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Message Queuing**: Reliable delivery with offline message storage
- **Authentication**: Secure WebSocket connections with token validation
- **Scalability**: Support for 100+ concurrent connections per project

### Real-time Synchronization
- **Document Updates**: Live sync of Project, Task, and Resource changes
- **Status Broadcasting**: Instant notification of status changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Optimistic updates with conflict detection
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency with immediate local updates
- **Selective Sync**: User-specific and role-based update filtering

### Mobile-Desktop Bridge
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamless sync between mobile apps and web interface
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Efficient data transmission for mobile networks
- **Battery Efficiency**: Optimized mobile WebSocket implementation
- **Offline Resilience**: Queue updates during connectivity loss
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older devices

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: WebSocket Infrastructure (Day 1)
- Set up WebSocket server with ERPNext integration
- Implement connection management and authentication
- Create message routing and broadcasting system
- Build basic client connection handling
- Test connection stability and performance

### Phase 2: Real-time Sync Engine (Day 2)
- Implement document change detection and broadcasting
- Create user-specific update filtering
- Build conflict resolution mechanisms
- Add offline queue management
- Test multi-user synchronization scenarios

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
```
ERPNext DocType Changes → Change Detector → WebSocket Server → Message Router → Connected Clients (Mobile/Desktop)
```

### WebSocket Server Components
- **Connection Manager**: Handle client connections and authentication
- **Message Router**: Route updates to relevant users and projects
- **Change Detector**: Monitor ERPNext DocType modifications
- **Queue Manager**: Handle offline message storage and delivery
- **Performance Monitor**: Track connection health and message delivery

### Message Types
```javascript
// Task Assignment
{
  type: 'task_assigned',
  data: { taskId, userId, projectId, priority },
  timestamp: ISO8601,
  sender: 'system'
}

// Status Update
{
  type: 'status_changed',
  data: { doctype, docname, old_status, new_status },
  timestamp: ISO8601,
  sender: userId
}

// Real-time Notification
{
  type: 'notification',
  data: { message, priority, actionRequired },
  timestamp: ISO8601,
  sender: userId
}
```

### Client-Side Implementation
- **Connection Wrapper**: Automatic reconnection and state management
- **Message Dispatcher**: Route incoming messages to appropriate handlers
- **Offline Queue**: Store outgoing messages during connectivity loss
- **Update Applier**: Apply real-time updates to local data store
- **Conflict Resolver**: Handle optimistic update conflicts

## Integration Points

### ERPNext Integration
- **DocType Hooks**: Trigger WebSocket updates on document changes
- **User Management**: Integrate with ERPNext user sessions and permissions
- **Project Context**: Filter updates based on user project assignments
- **Security Layer**: Validate permissions for real-time data access

### Mobile Integration
- **Progressive Web App**: WebSocket support in PWA context
- **Background Sync**: Handle updates when app is backgrounded
- **Push Notifications**: Critical updates via system notifications
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient connection management

### Desktop Integration
- **Web Interface**: Live updates in ERPNext web client
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Real-time project status displays
- **Notification System**: Browser-based update notifications
- **Multi-tab Sync**: Consistent state across browser tabs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Requirements

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Seamless real-time updates without page refresh
- [ ] Visual indicators for real-time connection status
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution
- [ ] Graceful degradation when WebSocket unavailable
- [ ] Minimal impact on application performance

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Message delivery latency < 500ms
- Connection uptime > 99%
