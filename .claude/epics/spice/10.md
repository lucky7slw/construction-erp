## Objective

Create a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) interface specifically designed for construction field workers, featuring touch-optimized forms, offline capability with intelligent sync, and streamlined workflows for data collection in challenging field conditions.

## Context

Construction field workers need mobile interfaces that work reliably in harsh conditions with limited connectivity. Current ERPNext interfaces are desktop-centric and don't address the specific needs of field work: large touch targets, simplified workflows, offline capability, and integration with device features like camera and GPS.

## User Stories

### Primary Stories
- **Field Worker**: Complete task updates using large, touch-friendly forms while wearing gloves
- **Site Inspector**: Capture photos and measurements offline, sync when connectivity returns
- **Equipment Operator**: Log equipment usage and maintenance needs during operation breaks
- **Materials Handler**: Scan QR codes and update inventory from delivery trucks

### Secondary Stories
- **Safety Officer**: Complete safety checklists on tablet during site walks
- **Quality Inspector**: Record inspection results with photos and measurements
- **Foreman**: Assign tasks and review progress during morning briefings
- **Surveyor**: Collect location data and measurements with GPS integration

## Technical Requirements

### Mobile-First Design
- **Touch Optimization**: Large buttons (44px+), finger-friendly spacing
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive design for phones, tablets, and rugged devices
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second load times on 3G networks
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, large text options, voice navigation
- **Device Integration**: Camera, GPS, NFC, barcode scanning

### Progressive Web App Features
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without network connection
- **App-like Experience**: Native app feel with web technologies
- **Installation**: Add to home screen, splash screen, app icons
- **Background Sync**: Intelligent data synchronization when connected
- **Push Notifications**: Critical updates and task assignments

### Field-Optimized Workflows
- **Single-Purpose Forms**: One task per screen, minimal scrolling
- **Visual Confirmation**: Large checkboxes, color-coded status indicators
- **Error Prevention**: Validation before submission, clear error messages
- **Quick Actions**: Common tasks accessible within two taps
- **Context Awareness**: Location-based form pre-filling

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: PWA Foundation (Day 1)
- Set up Progressive Web App infrastructure
- Implement offline-first architecture with service workers
- Create mobile-responsive base layout and navigation
- Build form component library with touch optimization
- Test PWA installation and offline functionality

### Phase 2: Field Data Collection (Day 2)
- Implement task completion forms with photo integration (Task 5)
- Create inventory update workflows with barcode scanning
- Build inspection and quality control interfaces
- Add GPS location capture and integration
- Test form workflows in simulated field conditions

### Phase 3: Sync and Integration (Day 3)
- Implement intelligent background synchronization
- Connect to extended DocTypes from Task 3
- Add conflict resolution for offline edits
- Create performance optimization for mobile networks
- Test end-to-end workflows with offline scenarios

## Technical Specifications

### PWA Architecture
```
Service Worker → Cache Management → Local Database → Sync Engine → ERPNext API
```

### Core Components
- **Service Worker**: Offline caching and background sync
- **Local Database**: IndexedDB for offline data storage
- **Sync Engine**: Intelligent upload/download management
- **Component Library**: Touch-optimized UI components
- **Camera Integration**: Photo capture with compression and metadata

### Mobile Interface Components

#### Task Completion Form
```javascript
{
  taskId: 'TASK-2',
  status: 'completed',
  photos: [
    {
      file: 'compressed_image.jpg',
      location: { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 },
      timestamp: '2025-09-20T15:30:00Z',
      metadata: { quality_check: true }
    }
  ],
  measurements: {
    length: 15.5,
    width: 8.2,
    units: 'meters'
  },
  notes: 'Foundation completed according to specifications'
}
```

#### Inventory Update Interface
- Barcode/QR code scanning
- Photo documentation of deliveries
- Quantity adjustment with visual confirmation
- Location tracking for material placement
- Batch processing for multiple items

#### Inspection Checklist
- Visual progress indicators
- Required photo fields
- Pass/fail status with comments
- Digital signatures for approvals
- Automatic report generation

### Offline Capabilities

#### Data Storage
- **Forms**: Local storage of incomplete forms
- **Photos**: Compressed image storage with metadata
- **Reference Data**: Cached project info, task lists, contacts
- **Sync Queue**: Pending uploads with retry logic

#### Sync Strategy
- **Incremental Sync**: Only changed data transmission
- **Priority Queue**: Critical updates first (safety, emergencies)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with manual override options
- **Bandwidth Awareness**: Adapt sync frequency to connection quality

## Integration Points

### ERPNext Integration
- **Task 3**: Extended DocTypes for field data collection
