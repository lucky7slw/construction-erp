## Objective

Create a conversational project management system that allows construction field workers to interact with ERPNext using natural language through voice and text input, providing context-aware query understanding and responses.

## Context

Construction field workers need hands-free, intuitive ways to access project information, update progress, and request assistance while on-site. Traditional ERP interfaces are too complex for field use, requiring a natural language interface that understands construction terminology and project context.

## User Stories

### Primary Stories
- **Field Supervisor**: "Show me today's deliveries for Building A" - Get instant access to delivery schedules
- **Site Worker**: "Report completion of foundation pour on Block 2" - Update task status via voice
- **Project Manager**: "What's the status of electrical work?" - Get comprehensive progress updates
- **Quality Inspector**: "Log safety inspection passed for Level 3" - Record inspections quickly

### Secondary Stories
- **Foreman**: "Who's assigned to roofing tomorrow?" - Check resource allocation
- **Safety Officer**: "Any safety incidents reported today?" - Monitor safety compliance
- **Materials Manager**: "How much concrete do we need next week?" - Check material requirements

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Natural Language Processing**: Integration with AI foundation (Task 2) for intent recognition
- **Voice Input Support**: Speech-to-text for hands-free operation in field conditions
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of current project, location, and user role
- **ERPNext Integration**: Direct queries to extended DocTypes (Task 3)
- **Response Generation**: Natural language responses with relevant data visualization

### Interface Components
- **Voice Command Interface**: Push-to-talk and continuous listening modes
- **Text Chat Interface**: WhatsApp-style conversation flow
- **Quick Actions**: Common queries as one-tap buttons
- **Context Indicators**: Display current project/location context
- **Result Visualization**: Charts, lists, and cards for query responses

### Query Capabilities
- **Project Status**: "What's the progress on Building A?"
- **Resource Allocation**: "Who's working on electrical today?"
- **Material Status**: "Do we have enough steel for next week?"
- **Schedule Queries**: "When is the next concrete delivery?"
- **Safety Reports**: "Show me this week's safety incidents"
- **Quality Control**: "What inspections are due tomorrow?"

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core NLP Engine (Day 1)
- Integrate with AI foundation from Task 2
- Implement intent classification for construction queries
- Create entity extraction for projects, tasks, resources
- Build context management system
- Test basic query understanding

### Phase 2: Voice Interface (Day 2)
- Implement speech-to-text with noise filtering
- Add text-to-speech for responses
- Create push-to-talk interface
- Handle background noise and field conditions
- Test voice recognition accuracy

### Phase 3: ERPNext Integration (Day 3)
- Connect to extended DocTypes from Task 3
- Implement secure query execution
- Add response formatting and visualization
- Create quick action templates
- Test end-to-end query flow

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
```
Voice/Text Input → NLP Engine → Intent Classifier → Query Generator → ERPNext API → Response Formatter → User Interface
```

### Key Components
- **Intent Classifier**: Recognize construction-specific queries
- **Entity Extractor**: Identify projects, tasks, resources, dates
- **Context Manager**: Maintain user session and project context
- **Query Builder**: Generate ERPNext API calls from intents
- **Response Generator**: Format data into natural language responses

### Integration Points
- **Task 2**: AI foundation for NLP capabilities
- **Task 3**: Extended DocTypes for data access
- **ERPNext Core**: Project, Task, and Resource management
- **Mobile Interface**: Voice input from construction sites
