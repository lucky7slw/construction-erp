## Overview

Ensure SPICE platform is production-ready with comprehensive performance monitoring, load testing, and deployment optimization to meet the <5% performance degradation target while handling real-world construction company workloads.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System performance monitoring dashboards implemented with comprehensive metrics
- [ ] Load testing validates 50+ concurrent users with AI features enabled
- [ ] Performance degradation remains <5% under full AI load
- [ ] Auto-scaling infrastructure configured for production deployment
- [ ] Error handling and logging systems provide comprehensive operational visibility
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy implemented for zero-downtime updates
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented and validated
- [ ] Production deployment checklist completed and verified

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

**Performance Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- Prometheus metrics collection for system and AI performance
- Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring and alerting
- Custom metrics for AI response times and accuracy tracking
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) integration

**Load Testing Framework:**
- JMeter test scripts for concurrent user simulation
- AI feature load testing with realistic data patterns
- Database performance testing under concurrent load
- WebSocket connection testing for real-time features

**Production Optimization:**
- Database query optimization and indexing strategy
- Redis caching optimization for AI responses
- CDN configuration for static assets
- Container resource allocation tuning

### Key Considerations

- AI service performance isolation to prevent cascade failures
- Graceful degradation when AI services are under load
- Monitoring for both technical metrics and business KPIs
- Automated alerting for performance threshold breaches

### Code Locations/Files Affected

- `infrastructure/monitoring/` - Monitoring configuration
- `infrastructure/deployment/` - Production deployment scripts
- `testing/performance/` - Load testing scripts
- `apps/spice/monitoring/` - Application-specific metrics

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: AI Service Foundation (core AI infrastructure required)
- [ ] Task 4: Security & Authentication Framework (security monitoring needed)
- [ ] Task 6: AI Photo Analysis Pipeline (core AI features for testing)
- [ ] Production infrastructure environment available
- [ ] Load testing tools and environments configured

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 24 hours (3 days)
- **Parallel**: false (final validation task requiring other components)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Performance monitoring system deployed and configured
- [ ] Load testing completed with documented results meeting performance targets
- [ ] Production deployment infrastructure validated and documented
- [ ] Error handling and logging systems operational
- [ ] Performance optimization recommendations implemented
- [ ] Production readiness checklist completed and signed off
- [ ] Deployment runbook created and validated
- [ ] System demonstrates <5% performance degradation under AI load
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies tested and validated
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
