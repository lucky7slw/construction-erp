# PRD: local-deploy

## Executive Summary

The local-deploy feature provides a Docker-first, one-command deployment solution for SPICE-ERPNext with automatic prerequisite installation and a definitive configuration wizard. It eliminates deployment complexity by containerizing the entire stack while providing intelligent auto-installation of missing prerequisites (Docker, etc.) and a guided configuration wizard that generates production-ready configurations.

The system transforms deployment from a complex, error-prone process into a reliable, containerized experience that works identically across all platforms.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Current local deployment of SPICE-ERPNext is complex, error-prone, and platform-specific:

1. **Complex Prerequisites**: Users must manually install and configure Python, Node.js, MariaDB, Redis, and other dependencies
2. **Platform Inconsistencies**: Different commands and procedures for Windows vs Unix-like systems
3. **Configuration Overhead**: Multiple configuration files, environment variables, and settings to manage
4. **Error-Prone Setup**: Common failures in encoding, permissions, database connections, and service starts
5. **Fragmented Documentation**: Multiple guides and scripts that don't work together seamlessly
6. **Validation Gaps**: No comprehensive testing of the deployed system before handoff to users

### Why is this important now?

- SPICE-ERPNext integration is complete but deployment remains a barrier to adoption
- Development teams need reliable local environments for testing and development
- Support burden is high due to deployment failures and environment inconsistencies
- Enterprise customers need proof-of-concept deployments before production commitment

## User Stories
