# PRD: Construction AI-ERP System

## Executive Summary

We're building a comprehensive, AI-first ERP system specifically designed for construction companies. The system addresses critical pain points in time tracking, expense management, and profit margin analysis while leveraging Gemini AI to automate routine tasks, allowing construction teams to focus on building rather than administrative overhead.

The solution consists of a full-stack web application with an iOS companion app, targeting small construction companies (sub-10 employees) with scalability to mid-market (50-500 employees). Initial modules include project management with interactive Gantt charts, sales/CRM functionality, and an intelligent automated quoting system.

**Value Proposition**: Reduce administrative burden by 70% through AI automation while improving project profitability visibility and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Time Tracking Chaos**: Manual time entry leads to inaccurate job costing and lost billable hours
- **Expense Blindness**: Poor expense tracking per project results in profit margin erosion
- **Profit Margin Mystery**: Lack of real-time visibility into project profitability
- **Administrative Burden**: Too much time spent on paperwork instead of actual construction work
- **System Failures**: Previous ERP attempts have failed due to complexity and poor user adoption

### Why Now?
- Small construction company growth requires better operational efficiency
- AI technology (Gemini) can now handle complex automation tasks
- Mobile-first workforce needs field-accessible solutions
- Competitive advantage through better project cost management

## User Stories
