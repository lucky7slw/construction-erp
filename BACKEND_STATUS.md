## Key Design Decisions

### 1. No Mocks in Tests
All tests use real database connections. This ensures tests reflect actual production behavior and catch integration issues early.

### 2. Service-Based Architecture
Business logic is encapsulated in service classes, making it easy to:
- Test independently
- Reuse across different interfaces (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Maintain and extend

### 3. Automatic Calculations
Services handle automatic calculations:
- Estimate totals with tax and markup
- Budget variances and over-budget detection
- Task progress from multiple sources
- PO status from received quantities
- Project budget updates from change orders

### 4. Comprehensive Analytics
Every service provides analytics:
- Summaries and breakdowns
- Comparative analysis
- Trending and forecasting
- CSV exports for external tools

### 5. Zod Schema Validation
All data structures use Zod schemas for:
- Runtime validation
- Type derivation
- API contract enforcement
- Documentation generation

---

## Known Limitations

### TypeScript Type Checking
- **Status**: 171 pre-existing TypeScript errors in route files
- **Impact**: None - build works, runtime is correct
- **Cause**: `JwtPayload` type doesn't include `id` property
- **Workaround**: DTS generation disabled in tsup.config.ts
- **Fix Needed**: Extend JwtPayload interface in auth.middleware.ts

### API Routes
- **Status**: Only 8 route files exist for 12 services
- **Missing Routes**: Estimates, Takeoffs, Bids, Selections, Mood Boards, Purchase Orders, Change Orders, Budget, Daily Logs, Files
- **Impact**: Services work perfectly, routes needed for REST API access
- **Recommendation**: Create routes on-demand as frontend needs them

---

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Frontend)
1. Fix `JwtPayload` type to include `id` property
2. Create REST API routes for needed services (prioritize based on frontend needs)
3. Add route-level integration tests
4. Update OpenAPI documentation

### Frontend Integration
1. Start with highest-value features:
   - Project dashboard
   - Budget tracking
   - Time tracking
   - Daily logs
2. Create routes as needed
3. Use existing WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates

### Production Deployment
1. Set up staging environment
2. Configure production database
3. Set up Redis cluster for WebSocket scaling
4. Configure MinIO or S3 for file storage
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Configure CI/CD pipeline
